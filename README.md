# Belly-Button-Challenge
Data Bootcamp Week 14 HW - Interactive Dashboard
This week's challenge was to create an interactive dashboard showcasing the findings of Bellybutton Biodiversity research results using Javascript.  

I had challenges with creating the bar chart so I commented out the code that I had.  For some reason the when I activated the code my page would go blank and the dropdown and bubble chart would not show.  I managed to get the bubble chart and dropdown to work using XpertLearner and some of the code from Professor Booth's example.
